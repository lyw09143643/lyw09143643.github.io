I can¡¯t read English passages quickly and can¡¯twrite a passage clearly. Now I plan to read more and practice writing often. Asfor listening, sometimes I can¡¯t understand what others are saying. So I planto improve myself by listening to the radio and TV. Grammar is the mostdifficult for me. I have no idea of it, but I think my English teacher can helpme with it</p>

      Howtime flies! It has been three years since I came to the school. My school isbeautiful and there are many beautiful flowers and trees. The teachers are sokind though there is always too much homework. My classmates are all veryfriendly to each other. We always help each other. I have learned a lot fromthem and made a lot of friends. I enjoy my school life. However, I don't dowell in math. I¡¯ll try my best to study math during the summer holidays. NowI'm going to say goodbye to my teachers and classmates. I'll miss my schoollife      </p>
      <p class="STYLE3">Recently,a large number of affairs about sexual assault were disclosed and reported bymass media. As far as I am concerned, people should get some enlightenment fromthese affairs, such as enhancing and strengthening education in self-protectionawareness, especially for children and students</p></td>
